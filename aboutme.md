My name is Nishanth Kumar. I'm a mathematician and financial sector researcher studying financial systems design, financial sector regulation and policy, retail financial markets, household finance and consumer protection. I dabble at using scrapy to scrap data and make visualisations. I love maps, networks, calculus and Manchester United.
